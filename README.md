# GitHub-Search-Functionality-Automation-Selenium-Cucumber
In this repository, I have automated the GitHub Search Functionality using Selenium, Java, JUnit, and Cucumber BDD Tools. This automation has the Page Object Model architecture with finished and smooth coding.

## Assigned Work Scenario
**Create a project with browser-based tests for the following acceptance criteria for github.com. You must use "Cucumber Framework".**
- As a guest, visit "https://github.com" and then scroll down to the end of the page, when clicking the "About" button in the landing page footer, you will be taken to the GitHub "About" page. Verify, you are on the About page.
- As a guest (not logged in), when searching GitHub for the term "create-react-app" from the about page search input, you will see a count of matching results.
- You will find and verify "facebook/create-react-app" project as the first result.
